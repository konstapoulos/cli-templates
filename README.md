# cli-templates
Template code to start development of command-line tools.

Code is able to:

  - parse arguments
  - perform logging
  - ask user for secret data
  - perform http requests
  - keep cookie files
  - run some other programs, supply args and get ouput
  - produce output in human and machine consumable way
  
Most of command line tools require the same features. I was tired recalling and
debugging this each time so I have created these templates.
